The remote sensing tools will have done most of the work for us for the moment, yet we will be exploring these satillite derived images in closer detail later. This is where we will have our first experience of using raster data, and some of the information we can obtain form such files."

Images of this fire were taken from many obiting craft, and one page displaying these images was on NASA's [Earth Observatory website](#http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/?eocn=topnav&eoci=logo).

In the case of the Fort McMurry fire, this helps to identify when various satellites flew over the correct section of Alberta. You will be looking at these swath paths in greater details later. \n",
