    "1. A **.shp** file which acts as the main file\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A **.shx** file which contains indexing data\n",

    "3. A **.dbf** file which is the database file, containing the geomtery attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- See *\"Learning Geospatial analysis with Python 2nd Ed\"* page 62 for more on file types. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples in this lesson we will be using files that have been retrieved as **.zip** packages, and unzipped or extraced into a directory with the same name as the files it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** if you wish to change a file name, you either do it to all the files in that folder, or use an app such as **QGIS Browser** to ensure you don't end up with an orphaned .shp file. That is, when you open a .shp file in QGIS, it is expecting there to be *at least* the .shx and .dbf files with the same name/prefix in the same directory. \n",

    "\n",
    "- At the time of writing, QGIS 3.x is on its way, but with an undertermined time frame. QGIS 3.0 will be using Python 3.x. see <a href='http://blog.qgis.org/2016/02/10/qgis-3-0-plans/'>QGIS 3 Blog.</a>. Switching between python 2 and python 3 is best left to those that have no other choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the pyShp library we can treat shapefiles like any other database file, and access most of its information in the form of lists. This is good practise for programming in general, and lets us explore the way shapefiles are generically written for all GIS application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we read and write files in pyShp we will be creating object instances, and is a *fairly* painless way to get acquainted with object orientated programming. \n",
